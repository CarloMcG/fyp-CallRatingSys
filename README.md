# Final Year Project
## Call Rating and Billing System
A cloud hosted call rating and billing system, allowing a VoIP company to bill customers in a similar manner as traditional telecommunication companies

This application is hosted on AWS using the following components of the AWS Ecosystem:
- AWS Amplify (Hosting)
- Amazon Cognito (User Account Management)
- DynamoDB (Storage)
- AWS AppSync (GraphQL APIs handling CRUD operations between Amplify and DynamoDB)

The frontend was developed using React, and implements Bootstrap.

Paypal was also incorporated as a payment module to allow customers to pay for calls.
